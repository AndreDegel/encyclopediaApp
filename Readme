This program is a little "encyclopedia" application, that retrieves a Wikipedia page, with the first two sentences,
10 Flickr pictures, and 10 Tweets, according to the users search.
If there is no internet connection, the search term doesn't exist, or the websites could not return enough
content, the program will respond accordingly. The only exception here is the Twitter response, that just
does not return anything if the search term does not exist.
To achieve all this I used some API's and want herby thank their creators because without them, this would
have been not as easy. I also want to mention the API's I used in case somebody want to modify or improve
this application.
